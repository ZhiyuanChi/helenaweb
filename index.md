### Mapping School Accessibiliy in Philadelphia 

How many top public schools can Philadelphia's students reach via SEPTA? Transit planning has traditionally revolved around the 9-5 commute. Students are off-peak travelers. How does the transit system serve them? In Philadelphia, school buses are provided up to the 6th grade. For students in 7th grades and above, the school district provides them with a free SEPTA pass for the school year. For these students, SEPTA is the school bus.

Not all schools are created equal, however - Philadelphia's criteria schools are considered the city's top public schools, and are highly competitive to get into. Admissions criteria aside, can students get to them?

My analysis found that the majority (68%) of middle schoolers and more than a third of high schoolers (39%) have no access to a criteria school within a half-hour transit commute. This accessibility changes over the course of the morning, and demonstrate how important students are as a portion of the city's off-peak commuters. Transit planners should consider the needs of students when planning routes for the city.

### Highway Infastructure and Real Estate Values in Wake County, NC

North Carolina is building NC-540, a beltway through Raleighâ€™s suburbs in Wake County. How might the upcoming NC-540 highway impact home values when it opens in 2023?

Using a K-means clustering analysis and a Random Forest Regression, I found that homes currently without highway access could see their homes' value boosted by about 18% on average.
