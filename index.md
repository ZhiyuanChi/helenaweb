### [Evaluating and Forecasting for Philadelphia's Bike Share Expansion]( https://indegoexpansion.web.app/)
[Indego](https://www.rideindego.com/), Philadelphia's bike share system, wants to expand their network to optimize for ridership, accessibility, and equity. To help Indegeo's planners evaluate different expansion plans, we created [Station Planner](https://indegoexpansion.web.app/). As our team's machine learning lead, I built a model that predicts areas of high and low ridership across Philadelphia.  Powered by these predictions, our interactive tool lets planners place new bike stations on the map to see what expected future ridership, accessibility, and equity looks like for the system.

This project was produced as part of the [University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Master of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) Spring 2023 Practicum course](https://pennmusa.github.io/MUSA_801.io/) with my colleagues [Minwook Kang](https://mintheworld.com/) and Aidan Rhianne.

### Identifying Urban Land in Indonesia Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Cities across the developing world are expanding rapidly. Yet few datasets include up-to-date information on land cover in developing countries, making it difficult to track this urban growth. To address this dearth of information, I worked with Tiffany Tran to pilot three machine learning algorithms to identify urban land in the city of Cirebon, Indonesia.

For this project, we created a novel dataset of satellite images of Cirebon and its surrounding area, based on the city's most recently mapped area (2014). We then used these images to train and test three different types of convolutional neural networks. Our best model accurately identified urban vs. non-urban images 82% of the time. 

But what we were really intersted in were the images that our models thought were urban areas, but according to the most recent mapping (2014) were *not* urban. The false positives gave us a feasible way to idetify areas of new urban expansion since 2014.

### [Predicting NJ Transit Delays](https://rradams.github.io/adams_rummler_MUSA508_final/Adams_Rummler_508_Final.html)
Commuters need to get to their destinations on time. To provide commuters with greater insight into their commute, my colleague [Jack Rummler](https://jtrummler.xyz/) and I created a fictional app that predicts train delays in advance.

Our app's predictive models were highly accurate - on average, our predictions were off by just 26 seconds. Our combination of models provided increasingly accurate delay predictions up to a week in advance.
