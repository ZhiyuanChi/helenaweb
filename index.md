### [Evaluating and Forecasting for Philadelphia's Bike Share Expansion]( https://indegoexpansion.web.app/)
[Indego](https://www.rideindego.com/), Philadelphia's bike share system, wants to expand their network to optimize for ridership, accessibility, and equity. To help Indegeo's planners evaluate different expansion plans, we created [Station Planner](https://indegoexpansion.web.app/). As our team's machine learning lead, I built a model that predicts areas of high and low ridership across Philadelphia.  Powered by these predictions, our interactive tool lets planners place new bike stations on the map to see what expected future ridership, accessibility, and equity looks like for the system.

Check out our [interactive app](https://indegoexpansion.web.app/), our [summary presentation](https://indegoexpansion.web.app/about), or follow along with our [code and report](https://indegoexpansion.web.app/html/Final_Presentation.html).

This project was produced as part of the [University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Master of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) Spring 2023 Practicum course](https://pennmusa.github.io/MUSA_801.io/) with my colleagues [Minwook Kang](https://mintheworld.com/) and Aidan Rhianne.

### [Predicting NJ Transit Delays](https://rradams.github.io/adams_rummler_MUSA508_final/Adams_Rummler_508_Final.html)
Commuters need to get to their destinations on time. To provide commuters with greater insight into their commute, my colleague [Jack Rummler](https://jtrummler.xyz/) and I created a fictional app that predicts train delays in advance.

Our app's predictive models were highly accurate - on average, our predictions were off by just 26 seconds. Our combination of models provided increasingly accurate delay predictions up to a week in advance.
