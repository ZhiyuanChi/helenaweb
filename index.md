### [Evaluating and Forecasting for Philadelphia's Bike Share Expansion]( https://indegoexpansion.web.app/)
[Indego](https://www.rideindego.com/), Philadelphia's bike share system, wants to expand their network to optimize for ridership, accessibility, and equity. To help Indegeo's planners evaluate different expansion plans, we created [Station Planner](https://indegoexpansion.web.app/). As our team's machine learning lead, I built a model that predicts areas of high and low ridership across Philadelphia.  Our interactive tool lets planners place new bike stations on the map to see what expected future ridership, accessibility, and equity looks like for the system.

This project was produced as part of the [University of Pennsylvania’s Master of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) Spring 2023 Practicum course](https://pennmusa.github.io/MUSA_801.io/) with my colleagues [Minwook Kang](https://mintheworld.com/) and Aidan Rhianne.

### [Predicting NJ Transit Delays](https://rradams.github.io/adams_rummler_MUSA508_final/Adams_Rummler_508_Final.html)
Commuters need to get to their destinations on time. To provide commuters with greater insight into their commute, my colleague [Jack Rummler](https://github.com/jtrummler) and I created a fictional app that predicts train delays in advance.

Our app's predictive models were highly accurate - on average, our predictions were off by just 26 seconds. Our combination of models provided increasingly accurate delay predictions up to a week in advance.

### [Highway Infastructure and Real Estate Values in Wake County, NC](https://rradams.github.io/MUSA550_Final/)

North Carolina is building NC-540, a beltway through Raleigh’s suburbs in Wake County. How might the upcoming NC-540 highway impact home values when it opens in 2023?

Using a K-means clustering analysis and a Random Forest Regression, I found that homes currently without highway access could see their homes' value boosted by about 18% on average.

### Mapping School Accessibiliy in Philadelphia 

How many top public schools can Philadelphia's students reach via SEPTA? In Philadelphia, school buses are provided up to the 6th grade. For students in 7th grades and above, the school district provides them with a free SEPTA pass for the school year. For these students, SEPTA _is_ the school bus.

Not all schools are created equal, however - Philadelphia's criteria schools are considered the city's top public schools, and are highly competitive to get into. Admissions criteria aside, can students get to them?

My analysis found that the majority (68%) of middle schoolers have no access to a criteria middle school within half an hour in the mornings.

More than a third (39%) of high schoolers have no access to a criteria high school.
